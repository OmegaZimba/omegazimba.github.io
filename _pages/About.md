# About Me

I am a first-year PhD student in Mathematics at Stellenbosch University, 
working under the supervision of Prof. Sophie Marques and Prof. Florian Luca. 

My research interests are **algebraic/birational geometry** and **field extensions**.
Currently, I am working on the theory of Galois descent as it relates to biquadratic field extensions.
